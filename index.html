			<p>I am currently a student at the UCF Coding Bootcamp receiving an education in full stack web development. Right now I have a stronger interest in the front-end side of things, but that could change as the course delves into back-end. At any rate by the end of the course I will have a sound base understanding of both.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have been in the workforce for 23 years the last 17 of which has been spent building a small retail company from one location to 4 locations and a web presence that sells nationally. Unfortunately, the retail landscape has changed severely in the last few years. Brick and mortar stores are losing severe ground to online behemoths like Amazon.com. Therefore, I am looking for a career change. I have always been interested in Tech and decided to plunge headfirst into the industry.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I will graduate with full stack web development skills, such as: Browser Based Technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Responsive Design; Server Side Development including Node.js/Express, PHP (Wordpress, CodeIgniter, Laravel), The LAMP Stack, Database, and other concepts including MySQL, MongoDB, Heroku, Security and Session Storage, User Authentication.</p>
			<br>
			<p> Please look over my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> and reach out to me on the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>
